# 🤖 Deepfake Detection System

A modern web application that detects deepfake manipulations in facial images using browser-based face recognition models. This tool allows users to upload an original and a suspect (test) image, analyze them, and identify discrepancies that could indicate AI-generated tampering.


## 🧠 Features

- 📷 Upload and compare two facial images
- 🧬 Analyze for potential deepfake alterations
- 🧠 **Runs entirely in-browser (no API required)**
- 🚫 No backend, no server-side computation
- 📦 Uses locally stored face recognition models in `public/models`
- 🛡️ Built-in Cybercrime Helpline awareness card

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **ML Models**: FaceAPI.js (TensorFlow.js-based face recognition)
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- **Backend**: 🚫 None – This is a fully static web app

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

> Make sure you have **Node.js** installed (recommended: ≥ 16.x)


# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sanjay-here/Deepfake_detection_system_website.git
cd deepfake-detection-system

# Install dependencies
>npm install

# Start development server
>npm run dev

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

📌 How It Works
Loads face detection and recognition models from public/models

Detects facial landmarks for both images

Compares facial descriptor vectors

Returns similarity score or decision logic via frontend script

🛡️ Important Note
This tool performs basic similarity analysis and should not be used as the sole forensic source. For legal or investigative use, consult professional deepfake detection systems.
